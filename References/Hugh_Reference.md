**Subject:** Semantic Searches and the Imitation Game

So to determine, ‘Is a computer sematic search as good as a
human search?’ one approach is…

1. Albert searches for a
   dozen synergi cases on ankle altercations.
2. Boris searches for a
   dozen cases on boiler botches.
3. Carsten searches for a
   dozen cases on compressor catastrophes.
4. etc.
5. Computer wizard
   Christopher Thiele prepares a computer generated list for each of the
   topic above. For ankle altercations, you now have 12 computer found cases
   and 12 human found cases, likewise for each failure type.
6. You sit Albert for 20
   questions, each one of the structure… ‘Is Case A or Case B more relevant
   to compressor catastrophes?’ where A is computer-selected case on
   compressors, B is human selected.
7. Repeat lots of times
   with lots of people.
8. Run a regression – a
   Student Test – to see if there is a statistical difference between
   computer- and human-searched cases.
9. This is a classic Turin
   Imitation Game to demonstrate whether the computer is clever… if you
   cannot distinguish between a computer and a human, the computer is clever.
10. Bob’s your uncle.

Hello Shariar,

Good work, I like how quickly and thoroughly you
work. I have a couple observations:

* Christopher has clearlydone a heap of work to analyse Synergi data with AI. You have references this obliquely, but not explicitly. For your work to be genuinely useful (beyond getting your degree) I think you will need to reference it and state how you will build on his good work. Perhaps not referencing it leaves you open to allegations?
* You have correctly identified the problem of mis-categorising process safety and occupational safety incidents. I think the opportunity is bigger than this: you can also categorise for #leaks or #workclearance or #managementofchange or other topics within process safety. I guess this is a specialisation within the general topic of body part extraction, but is it explicitly stated?
* In months 1-2, I would expect you to visit several industrial sites, so you have some background and context, not only to inform your research, but also for your general education. Will you include this?
* Have you spoken to Haritha? How do your proposal and hers complement each other?

Happy to discuss.

Regards, Hugh.

Incident reporting Process:

There was a fire in RoCa.

In 1 hour Notification on REACT.

Production manager - PM - Simon - Pedro - Holger (Question for all process safety cases)

Before Synergi life case was entered.

Written 24/72 hour report. (Evidence of golden hours, interviews emergency)

Simon - i want an investigation - Nigel, Trevor

BESCAT??

Terms of reference - Simon sponser, Specific question that asked

2-3 months of investigation - Investigation report - Technical cause, underlining organization of causes, WCM

Return to Service risk assesment - (What can go worng) -  People, Planet, Plant, Production, Reputation
