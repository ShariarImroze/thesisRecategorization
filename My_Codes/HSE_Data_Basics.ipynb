    "The work presented herein serves as a preliminary exercise in preparation for my thesis. It involves the utilization of a publicly available HSE dataset to refine my coding skills and establish a suitable coding environment for my upcoming research. While this endeavor draws inspiration from the methodologies employed by Christopher Thiele, it is not a direct replication of his work. Instead, it represents an independent attempt to enhance the efficiency of the existing models, with a particular emphasis on reducing computational time without sacrificing accuracy. It is important to note that this preliminary work has been conducted without adherence to academic or professional standards, nor has it involved the use of proprietary Uniper data. The objective has been to conceptualize improvements based on Christopher's approaches, reimagined and implemented in a unique manner."
